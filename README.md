#Is it recycling week?

Quickly lookup the recycling pickup schedule for the current week.

This open source app was written for citizens wanting to know if it is a recycling pickup week or not via Android devices.

Currently, data is available for Appleton, Greenville, Seymour, New London, Kaukauna, Little Chute, Kimberly, Combined Locks and other points in-between in Outagamie County in Northeast Wisconsin.

Available on the Google Play store: [Is it recycling week?](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=theputnams.net.isitrecyclingweek)

##Goals:

* Do one thing, do it well. Resist the temptation to grow the features/purpose of the app to include more than determining if it is recycling week. If some other municipal data app would be useful, create a separate app.
* Be and stay open source. Contribute to and benefit from the local and global community of civic hackers.
* No advertisements. As a community-built, donated-time application let's not sell any products, mkay?
* Cost $0.00 and minimal time investment to maintain. Many Internet services/APIs provide a free tier of resources.
* Do not become data stewards if we can help it. The municipality already owns the data.
* Be usable by all citizens by being available in more than just the english language.
